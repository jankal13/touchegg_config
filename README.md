# touchegg_config
Configuration file for Touchegg to have Mac-like feeling

## Getting Started

After Touchegg is installed and we added Multigestures (e.g. through geis-tools) we need to add corresponding gestures to it. If you didn't add Multigestures yet, feel free to follow this tutorial: https://www.maketecheasier.com/add-multitouch-gestures-ubuntu/

# Commands we want

To get a Mac-like feeling for Linux we need to first know which gestures are supported by the tool. You can find the list of them here: https://github.com/JoseExposito/touchegg/wiki/All-gestures-supported-by-Touch%C3%A9gg

The actions can be found here: https://github.com/JoseExposito/touchegg/wiki/All-actions-supported-by-Touch%C3%A9gg


The actions we want to have with Touchegg are:
...
3 Fingers - Left	Go Next on Browser
3 Fingers - Right	Go Back on Browser
3 Fingers - Up	Show all Windows
3 Fingers - Down	Close Expos√© (Esc)
4 Fingers - Left	Next Desktop
4 Fingers - Right	Previous Desktop
4 Fingers - Up	Next Desktop
4 Fingers - Down	Previous Desktop
...

# Steps

First we need to create the configuration file. For that we first generate the corresponding folder for Touchegg.
...
sudo mkdir ~/.config/touchegg/
...
Next, we create the config file.
...
sudo nano ~/.config/touchegg/touchegg.conf
...
After that we can add our commands to the config:
...
sudo nano ~/.config/touchegg/touchegg.conf
...
###
The commands

...
[FOUR_FINGERS_DRAG_DOWN]
action=SHOW_DESKTOP
settings=

[FOUR_FINGERS_DRAG_LEFT]
action=CHANGE_DESKTOP
settings=PREVIOUS

[FOUR_FINGERS_DRAG_RIGHT]
action=CHANGE_DESKTOP
settings=NEXT

[THREE_FINGERS_DRAG_UP]
action=MAXIMIZE_RESTORE_WINDOW
settings=

[THREE_FINGERS_DRAG_DOWN]
action=MINIMIZE_WINDOW
settings=  

[THREE_FINGERS_DRAG_LEFT]
action=CHANGE_VIEWPORT
settings=PREVIOUS

[THREE_FINGERS_DRAG_RIGHT]
action=CHANGE_VIEWPORT
settings=NEXT

...


We save our file by using STRG + O and then exit the editor by STRG + X.

Now Touchegg should provide a Mac-ish feeling.
